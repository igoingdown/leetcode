# LEETCODE

# Some codes are solutions of the algorithm problems on the leetcode web.
# While the other codes are demos or the implementation of some classic algorithms, like quick-sort and binary-search.
# I wrote some codes using xcode as IDE while the other codes are written on leetcode web page.
# I like c++-11 very much.
# Shell script is very useful.
# I can commit modification automatically from now on with shell.
