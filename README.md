# LEETCODE

Some codes are solutions of the algorithm problems on the leetcode website.
While the other codes are demos or the implementation of some classic algorithms, like quick-sort and binary-search.

I wrote some codes on Xcode while the other codes are written on leetcode website page.

I like c++-11 very much.

Shell script is very useful.
Now I can commit modification automatically with shell script.
It's really exciting!

# leetcode_note.txt
This is a note recording the fight between me and the algorithms.

# buddy_system_implement_and_test
This is an implement of buddy system, which is used in the linux kernal for memmory management.
Source code is copyed from https://github.com/wuwenbin/buddy2.
