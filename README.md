# LEETCODE

Some codes are solutions of the algorithm problems on the leetcode web.
While the other codes are demos or the implementation of some classic algorithms, like quick-sort and binary-search.

I wrote some codes on Xcode while the other codes are written on leetcode web page.

I like c++-11 very much.

Shell script is very useful.
I can commit modification automatically from now on with shell script.
It's really exciting!
